ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANCIENT CHINA, THERE LIVED A MAN NAMED SHI. HE WAS A POET AND A PHILOSOPHER, KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAND FOR HIS WISDOM AND INSIGHT. SHI LIVED IN A STONE DEN, DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAINS. HE HAD CHOSEN THIS REMOTE LOCATION BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO MEDITATE IN PEACE AND SOLITUDE, SURROUNDED BY THE BEAUTY OF NATURE. ONE DAY, A GROUP OF TRAVELERS STUMBLED UPON SHI'S DEN, EXHAUSTED AND HUNGRY FROM THEIR JOURNEY. THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND A MAN LIVING IN SUCH A REMOTE LOCATION, AND EVEN MORE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT HE WAS A POET. SHI WELCOMED THE TRAVELERS WITH OPEN ARMS, OFFERING THEM FOOD AND DRINK. TO THEIR AMAZEMENT, HE HAD A STASH OF LION MEAT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT DURING HIS TRAVELS THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS. HE COOKED THE MEAT FOR HIS GUESTS, AND THEY FOUND IT TO BE DELICIOUS. AS THEY ATE, SHI RECITED SOME OF HIS POETRY FOR THE TRAVELERS, MESMERIZING THEM WITH HIS WORDS. SHISHI SHISHI SHI SHI, SHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI. SHI SHISHI SHI SHI SHI SHI. SHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI. SHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI. SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI SHISHI. SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI, SHI SHISHI. SHISHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI SHISHI.SHISHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI. SHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI, SHI SHI SHI SHI SHI. SHI SHI SHI SHI. THE TRAVELERS WERE ENCHANTED BY SHI'S WORDS, THE RHYTHM OF HIS VOICE LIKE A SOOTHING MELODY. THEY TALKED ABOUT HIS POETRY AND HIS PHILOSOPHY FOR DAYS, LEARNING FROM HIM AND SHARING THEIR OWN STORIES. THEY TALKED ABOUT THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS, THEIR FEARS AND DOUBTS, AND FOUND SOLACE IN SHI'S GENTLE PRESENCE. EVENTUALLY, THE TIME CAME FOR THE TRAVELERS TO LEAVE. THEY THANKED SHI FOR HIS HOSPITALITY AND HIS TEACHINGS, PROMISING TO SPREAD HIS WISDOM THROUGHOUT THE LAND. AS THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THE STONE DEN, THEY LOOKED BACK AT SHI, STANDING THERE IN THE DOORWAY, HIS GAZE FIXED ON THE MOUNTAINS. THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT MAN, A MAN WHO HAD DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH AND BEAUTY. AND SO, SHI CONTINUED TO LIVE IN HIS STONE DEN, MEDITATING AND WRITING POETRY, INSPIRING OTHERS TO LIVE THEIR LIVES WITH GRACE AND WISDOM. HE KNEW THAT THE WORLD WAS FULL OF PAIN AND SUFFERING, BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT THERE WAS BEAUTY AND JOY TO BE FOUND, IF ONLY ONE KNEW WHERE TO LOOK. HE ALSO KNEW OF A FLAG, THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. THE FLAG SAID: DCTF{th3_pr0f_wiLL_b3_h3aring_ab0ut_th1s}
